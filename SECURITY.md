# Security Policy

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please:

1. Do not open a public issue.
2. Email the maintainer privately (see GitHub profile) with details and reproduction steps.
3. We will acknowledge receipt within 72 hours and coordinate a fix and disclosure.

We recommend running `govulncheck` and keeping dependencies up to date.
