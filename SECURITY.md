# Security Policy

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please:

1. Do not open a public issue.
2. Email the security team privately at security@redactyl.dev with details and reproduction steps. If email is unavailable, contact the maintainer via the GitHub profile.
3. We will acknowledge receipt within 72 hours and coordinate a fix and disclosure.

We recommend running `govulncheck` and keeping dependencies up to date.
